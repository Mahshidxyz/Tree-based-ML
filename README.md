# Tree-based-ML
Classification using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost 

This repository contains two projects:

1) Building and visualizing a decision tree for predicting heart disease. 
2) Using Random Forest and XGBoost on the same dataset to improve the performance.


The data is from the Heart Disease Dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) which required preprocessing. The data has 303 rows and 14 features. For all three models, I used cross validation and hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting. The models achieved an 80-90% recall and accuracy.
